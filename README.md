### Description

This control creates a splitter bar with 2 resizable panels. The panels are adjustable by a specifying the size of the Child1 panel through the PanelSize property. It also includes minimum and maxmimum size parameters. It is well commented and also provides a demo application to explain all the options. I would also like to thank Mark Joyal for his great SplitterControl on which this is based. His control provides a way to resize based by a percentage, while mine provides a way to resize based on a size value.

Since this is my first Active-X control, I would really appreciate your votes and any feedback you can provide.
